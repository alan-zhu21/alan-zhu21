- 👋 Hi, I’m @alan-zhu21
- 👀 I’m interested in data/research tools, automation, fun, unique projects, and ai-generated art/music
- 🌱 I’m currently learning or have learned Javascript, Node, Express, Jest, Python, Flask, and others. I want to deepen my knowledge in Python programming. Specifically, I am tinkering with tkinter, selenium, and learning DSA topics. I want to be able to apply my skills to create automation tools for enterprise business users. I am also carefully learning SQL querying and theory.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating unique backend systems or automation tools that improve lives or enhance efficiencies.
