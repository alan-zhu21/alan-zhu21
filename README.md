- 👋 Hi, I’m @alan-zhu21
- 👀 I’m interested in data, automation tools, and creating useful tools.
- 🌱 I’m currently an employed data engineer learning about systems design and better CI/CD. It may take me down the road to dev ops or data ops in the future.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on discussions and theory. Conversations about best practices and why are fun.
- 📫 How to reach me - you cannot reach me.
